This is a small cross-platform 3D game engine.

It's purpose was for me to learn C++ while actually doing something concrete.
The project was initially developed between July and December 2013.
New start in 2018 to finish the TODO list.

Libraries used:
 - Irrlicht for 3D graphics
 - IrrKlang for sounds
	
TODO (I may need your help):
 - Display ammo when shot (they disappeared when I removed the physics part)
 - Debug the Target class (it disappeared when I removed the physics part)
 - In game pause menu when pressing the escape key
 - Back to main menu after death
 - Bigger city by putting 8 times the same model arround the first central one (not sure if well explained) --> easy, I'll do it soon
 - NPC AI for single player mode (could be simple zombies in the beginning, I love zombies)
 - A map editor (no need for a separate binary since we're working on a game engine and not really a game)
 - A splash screen during loading time between main menu and actual game
 - Better HUD
 - More graphical content (levels, weapons, NPCs, ...)

Art work is not mine. I only did the code.
